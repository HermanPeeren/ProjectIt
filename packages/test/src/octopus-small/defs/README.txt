This project is a reduced version of the language(s) used in our 2003 project Octopus
(an OCL tool for precise UML specifications).

* The language does not contain collections/generic types.
* The language needs to be extended with the operators on primitive types from
  the OCL standard library.
* The parser is not yet able to read PathNames such as "Dvd::price".
